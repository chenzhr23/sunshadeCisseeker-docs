Changelog
=========

1.3.5 — independent parallel pages (current release)
----------------------------------------------------

* **Fixed: pages started together showed "100% finished" while the other
  runs were still going.** The run bookkeeping files were keyed by the GUI
  process id, so simultaneous runs (Nuclear + Chloroplast + Mitochondrial)
  overwrote each other's pid/status/output files: every page displayed the
  first run's exit state, the logs interleaved, and Stop killed whichever
  run had written the pid file last. Every started run now gets its own
  files ``/tmp/sunshadecisseeker-gui/run-<scope>-<pid>-<time>-<seq>.pid`` /
  ``.status`` / ``.out``, and the run id is the first line of each page's
  log (``run started | id=... | scope=...``). Logs, progress bars and
  Run/Stop buttons are now strictly per page.
* **Fixed: a run that died without an exit status was reported as
  success.** A run killed by a signal or the out-of-memory killer (common on
  shared servers) left no status file, which the GUI read as "exit code 0".
  Such runs are now reported as an abnormal end (exit code 137).
* **Fixed: per-run log collisions under ``log/``.** Two scopes started in
  the same second shared one timestamped log file; the name now includes the
  scope and the process id
  (``log/sunshadeCisseeker_<scope>_<date>_<pid>.log``).

1.3.4
-----

* Live Qt progress bar on every analysis page ("Step 4/6 — promoter
  extraction — 46%"), parsed from the pipeline's own step markers and
  percentage lines — no pipeline changes required.
* Standalone **Label ecology** step (cross-genome step 06) with its own GUI
  page: the NCBI+Custom merge (step 05) stays label-free, and labelling can
  be redone at any time without re-running the genome pipeline.
* Faster organelle promoter extraction — constant-time interval mathematics
  for circular genomes (byte-identical to the previous per-base walk) — plus
  a streaming, bounded-memory combiner for the per-pair tables and FASTA
  files, so very large runs no longer exhaust memory at the final combine.
* Hardened download retries in steps 02/03: deterministic HTTP 4xx errors
  fail immediately, NCBI 429 rate limiting is probed a bounded number of
  times (``--rate-retries=``), and every kept file passes a FASTA/GFF3
  format check before being accepted.

Earlier versions
----------------

Initial releases: the six-step per-genome pipeline (NCBI species metadata,
FASTA+GFF3 download, promoter extraction, NCBI+Custom merge, universal CRE
scan), the cross-genome ecology comparison (steps 06–09), the Qt 5.15
psiFinder-style desktop interface, and the one-shot conda installer.
